# Real-time-parallel-parking-system

Summary

Parallel Parking Assist System (PPAS) is a design as one of the growing technologies that aims to enhance the comfort and safety of driving. With the problems of increasing shortage of parking space and congestion cause by traffic, these make PPAS become more demanding. PPAS is about to develop a new sensor system with high accuracy by using voice guidance.

The objectives of the project: 

i.   To design a parallel parking assist system with voice guidance
ii.  To develop the sensor system for parallel parking
iii. To analyse the accuracy of the sensor like vibration and filter regarding to the measuered distance

Software and Hardware:

Arduino Uno
High Resolution Ultrasonic Range Finder Sensors (LV-MaxSonar-EZ1)
Voice module
Arduino IDE
